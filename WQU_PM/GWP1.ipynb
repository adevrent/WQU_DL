    "**Small Minus Big (SMB)** factor is a size effect by the market capitalization of a firm. SMB identifies the historical differential of small-cap companies from those of large-cap companies. Once SMB is found, its beta coefficient ($\\beta_2$) can be estimated using linear regression. The main reason behind this factor is that, in the long term, small-cap companies tend to get a higher return compared to big-cap business companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**High Minus Low (HML)** factor can be considered as a value premium. It captures the differential in value company returns between value firms with a high book-to-market value ratio and firms with low book-to-market value ratios. Like the SMB factor, after the HML factor is calculated, its beta coefficient ($\\beta_3$) can also be determined through linear regression. The HML factor indicates that, over the long term, value stocks (high book-to-market ratio) have superior returns to growth stocks (low book-to-market ratio)."
